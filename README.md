## Configuration

Before using the Code Detector API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart)

The Code Detector API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/codedetector](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/codedetector).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const codedetectorAPI = require('@apiverve/codedetector');
const api = new codedetectorAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = "a = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user\n# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))\n# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))\n# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))\n\n# calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# calculate the area\narea = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5\nprint('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)";

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = "a = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user\n# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))\n# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))\n# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))\n\n# calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# calculate the area\narea = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5\nprint('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)";

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = "a = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user\n# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))\n# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))\n# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))\n\n# calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# calculate the area\narea = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5\nprint('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)";

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "likelihood": 0.95,
    "family": "PYTHON",
    "current": "python",
    "readable": "Python Code",
    "extension": ".py"
  }
}
```
